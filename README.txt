This Solution has 3 projects: the version with SQL Functionality, which fully works, and that which does not have SQL functionality (CMSNoSQL), only having the design and some of the functionality.
To switch between them, just right click on the one you want to open and select "Define as start-up Project".

Furthermore, you can also find a MSSQL Database project. 
If you want to use your own DB, please, publish the database, copy the connection string and paste it in the proper field in the app.config file in the CollegeManagementSystem Project.
For simplicity purposes, I spined up a MSSQL DB on AWS'S RDS, and you can use SQL functionality with that DB.

If you have any doubts, you may contact me on 31494@aemsacramento.edu.pt or on nelsonramos@protonmail.com.

Enjoy!
